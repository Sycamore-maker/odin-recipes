# odin-recipes

Saturday 6/15 
First Odin project! I've read through the instructions once before starting to make sure I have a general idea of what I'm going to be doing, and it looks pretty straightforward. The instructions are very clear, and I'm sure that's because I'm still in the "hand-holding" stage of the program they talked about earlier. I certainly haven't hit any lack of motivation so far and I'm always excited to get time to open my Surface and do a lesson. I'm gonna come back after I'm done with the recipes project to complete the assignment for the README.md.

Sunday 6/16
Just finished adding my second recipe and I'm feeling more confident but like I still need more practice. I can do the html boilerplate now from memory, but I still need to reference the instructions when commiting.

Still Sunday 6/16 - Final thoughts and self-reflection
It took me less than half an hour to add the last recipe. I'm now moderately comfortable with adding images and href anchors.

Project in review
In this project I learned:
*html boilerplate
*elements including hyperlink references, both absolute and relative, as well as image elements that include alternate text and picture demensions
*ordered and unordered lists
*how to create spaced paragraphs using <p></p>
*how to use different sized text heading
*became more comfortable using the command line to create and move files
*how to create and clone repositories in Github (I feel the need for more information/practice with this before I can say I'm truly comfortable)
*learned how to stage, commit, and push my changes to Github
*learned the importance of commit messages and how they should be structured
*realized the method I prefer for completing projects, which is the decide how I want the page to look and have the exact text I want to add ready before I start, otherwise I become frustrated by trying to code and write content at the same time
