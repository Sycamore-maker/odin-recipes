# odin-recipes

Saturday 6/15 
First Odin project! I've read through the instructions once before starting to make sure I have a general idea of what I'm going to be doing, and it looks pretty straightforward. The instructions are very clear, and I'm sure that's because I'm still in the "hand-holding" stage of the program they talked about earlier. I certainly haven't hit any lack of motivation so far and I'm always excited to get time to open my Surface and do a lesson. I'm gonna come back after I'm done with the recipes project to complete the assignment for the README.md.

Sunday 6/16
Just finished adding my second recipe and I'm feeling more confident but like I still need more practice. I can do the html boilerplate now from memory, but I still need to reference the instructions when commiting.
